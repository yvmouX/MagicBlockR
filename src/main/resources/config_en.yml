# If set to false, the binding system will be disabled and blocks won't be bound to players
# ⚠️ Requires restart: Core system feature that affects plugin initialization
enable-binding-system: true

# Whether to allow other players to use blocks that are bound to another player
# If set to true, players can use blocks even if they are bound to someone else

# ✅ Hot-reloadable: Changes take effect immediately with /mb reload
allow-use-bound-blocks: false

# Whether to remove the magic block when its uses are depleted
# If set to true, the block will be removed from the player's inventory and bound list when uses reach 0

# Shop plugins can set post-purchase console command: mb addtimes %player% [uses]
# This way players automatically get uses added to their held magic block when purchasing
# Note: Players must be holding a magic block when purchasing, otherwise the command will fail
